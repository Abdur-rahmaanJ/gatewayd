# Plugin configuration file for GatewayD

# The verification policy controls how the output of the plugin's hook, that is, its result,
# should be handled and whether to verify the output or not.
# - "passdown" (default): the output of the plugin is passed down to the next plugin,
#   regardless of the result. The result is not verified.
# - "ignore": the output of the current plugin is ignored if the verification fails, and
#   the next plugin is called with the same input.
# - "abort": the output of the current plugin is ignored if the verification fails, and
#   the next plugin is not called.
# - "remove": the output of the current plugin is ignored if the verification fails, and
#   the next plugin is called with the same input. The current registered hook from the
#   current plugin is removed from the list of registered hooks and it will not be called
#   again.
verificationPolicy: "passdown"

# The compatibility policy controls how GatewayD treats plugins' requirements. If a plugin
# requires a specific version of another plugin, the compatibility policy controls whether to
# allow or reject the plugin.
# - "strict" (default): the plugin is rejected if it requires a specific version of another
#   plugin and that version is not the one currently loaded.
# - "loose": the plugin is allowed to run even if it requires a specific version of another
#   plugin and that version is not the one currently loaded.
compatibilityPolicy: "strict"

# The acceptance policy controls how new dynamic hooks are handled. If a plugin registers a
# new hook, the acceptance policy controls whether to accept or reject the new hook.
# - "accept" (default): the new hook is accepted and registered.
# - "reject": the new hook is rejected and not registered.
acceptancePolicy: "accept"

# The metrics policy controls whether to collect and merge metrics from plugins or not.
# The Prometheus metrics are collected from the plugins via a Unix domain socket. The metrics
# are merged and exposed via the GatewayD metrics endpoint via HTTP.
enableMetricsMerger: True

# The metrics merger period controls how often the metrics merger should collect and merge
# metrics from plugins.
metricsMergerPeriod: 5s

# The health check period controls how often the health check should be performed. The health
# check is performed by pinging each plugin. Unhealthy plugins are removed.
healthCheckPeriod: 5s

# The plugin configuration is a list of plugins to load. Each plugin is defined by a name,
# a path to the plugin's executable, and a list of arguments to pass to the plugin. The
# plugin's executable is expected to be a Go plugin that implements the GatewayD plugin
# interface via the GatewayD plugin SDK using gRPC. The args field is optional and is passed
# as command line arguments to the plugin's executable. The env field is used to pass extra
# environment variables to the running instance of the plugin. The MAGIC_COOKIE_KEY and
# MAGIC_COOKIE_VALUE environment variables are used to verify the identity of the plugin and
# are required. The env field is optional if the MAGIC_COOKIE_KEY and MAGIC_COOKIE_VALUE are
# hardcoded in the plugin's executable. The checksum field is mandatoryy and is used to verify
# the integrity of the plugin's executable. The checksum is a SHA256 hash of the plugin's
# executable. Checksum verification will change in the future for better security and automation.
